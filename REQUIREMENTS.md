# Exam in Fullstack Node.js Spring 2023

Both individual and group work is allowed. No groups larger than 3. You still need to understand all the code. Collaborations across electives are also allowed.

## Deadline: 
Check Wiseflow for when the hand-in deadline is. You must submit a full stack project by then but you can still work on your project up until the exam. You will only be evaluated based on the final project. Upload a Git link to your project (PDF) or the code (requires an empty PDF first). 

## Scope: 
There should be enough features that you can talk incessantly for 5-6 minutes while showcasing your product.

## Hard requirements: 
You need to fulfill these requirements to pass the exam:
Backend
Use Express
Use a database (You need access to your database through the terminal and be able to write your own queries to it during the exam).
Authentication and authorization. 
Frontend
Plain HTML, template engines or Svelte are okay.
Use Fetch.
Use Sockets.
Authentication and authorization. 

## Soft requirements (You should fulfill these too): 
You must have a clean code base and your code style should be consistent. 
You must make an attempt at styling your website. Styling frameworks can be used. User experience is important too. 

## Bonus:
Host your application.
Requirement whether the project is hosted or not: Remember that your product needs to be production ready. Not in development mode. 
It shouldnâ€™t be littered with console logs. This also means that it should be legal and conform to GDPR. 



## Exam:
Learn how to zoom in on your code. 

First 5-6 minutes, demo your exam project.
(Which means no code but actually showing features.)

We will talk about your exam project. Code and more.

You will be asked to live code!
You are not allowed to use snippets or code assisting tools (Copilot etc.) during the exam. IntelliSense is allowed.
