Implement filters and sorting options to refine the search results.
Display search results in a visually appealing, responsive layout using Svelte.
### Event Registration & Attendance:

Ticket sale
Implement a feature to track attendance and display the list of attendees on the event page.

### Database:
Use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store user and event data.
Create database schemas for users, events, and attendance.
Implement CRUD operations for managing data.
### API:
